# Project Goals:

- Generate a color palette from the base color
- Discern sensible palette variations based on a base color (dark, medium, light)
- Allow button style types (subtle gradient, shiny gradient)
- Make it easy to override/modify styles
- Reduce weight of generated styles (define button base, add color through additional classes)
- Create good defaults
- Ensure approximate consistency for browsers that don't support CSS gradients
- Style the button element
- Provide a decent alternative styling for ie6
